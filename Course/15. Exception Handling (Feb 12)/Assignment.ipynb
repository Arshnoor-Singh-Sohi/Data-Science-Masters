    "In Python, an exception is an event or condition that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python generates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as its type and a description. Exception handling allows you to deal with these errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing and enabling you to take corrective actions or provide appropriate feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common types of exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SyntaxError:** This is a type of exception that occurs when there is a syntax error in your code. Syntax errors are typically detected by the Python interpreter before the program runs, and they prevent the program from executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ZeroDivisionError:** This exception occurs when you try to divide a number by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NameError:** This exception occurs when you try to access a variable or name that does not exist in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TypeError:** This exception occurs when an operation is performed on an object of an inappropriate data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ValueError:** This exception occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but with an inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cause of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exceptions**: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, usually as a result of runtime conditions such as invalid user input, file not found, or division by zero.\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors**: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program runs. They result from incorrect code syntax, such as missing parentheses or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Detection Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exceptions**: Exceptions are detected while the program is running, and they can occur in response to user actions or external factors.\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors**: Syntax errors are detected before the program starts executing, during the parsing phase when Python is converting your code into bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exceptions**: You can handle exceptions using try-except blocks, allowing you to gracefully recover from errors and continue the program's execution.\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors**: Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed. They cannot be caught or handled using try-except blocks because they prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors in Python, but they differ in their causes, detection times, and how they are handled. Exceptions occur during program execution and can be handled, while syntax errors are detected before execution and must be fixed in the code.\n"
