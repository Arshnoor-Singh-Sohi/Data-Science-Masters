    "The close() function is used in Python to close an open file. It is important to close a file explicitly after you are done reading from or writing to it. Closing a file serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Management:\n",
    "Files are a limited and shared resource in a computer system. If you don't close a file after using it, it remains open, and the operating system may limit the number of files that can be open simultaneously. Closing a file releases system resources associated with the file, such as file handles and memory buffers, allowing other programs to use those resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Integrity: \n",
    "When you write data to a file, it may not be immediately written to the file on disk. Instead, it is often buffered in memory for performance reasons. Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is flushed (written) to the file on disk, preserving the data's integrity. If you don't close the file, data may be lost if the program terminates unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Locking: \n",
    "Some operating systems and file systems may have restrictions on concurrent access to a file. When you open a file, it may be locked for exclusive access by your program. Closing the file releases the lock, allowing other programs or processes to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portability: \n",
    "While most operating systems automatically close open files when a program terminates, it's considered good practice to close files explicitly in your code. This ensures that your code behaves consistently across different platforms and doesn't rely on platform-specific behavior.\n",

The file is automatically closed when the code block is exited, whether it is exited normally or due to an exception. This ensures that resources are released correctly and promptly. Without the with statement, you would need to explicitly call file.close(), and it's easy to forget or overlook this, potentially leading to resource leaks.\n",
